In this repository, I store my solutions to problems from the book "Algorithms in Java. Fourth Edition" written by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. <br><br>
I used a library from their book in solving problems: <a href = "https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar">"algs4.jar"</a>, licensed by GNU (GPL) v.3.<br>
If you find anything incorrect you can create an issue or open a pull request.<br>
I used the 2019 edition in Russian. The order of assignments may vary from edition to edition.<br><br>
