# "Algorithms in Java. Fourth edition"
**Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne**<br><br>
In this repository, I store my solutions to problems from the book "Algorithms in Java. Fourth Edition" written by Robert Sedgwick and Kevin Wayne. <br><br>
I used in solving problems from their book their library "stdlib.jar", licensed by GNU (GPL) v.3.<br>
